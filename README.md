# Library-Queue-Manager
The Library Queue Manager is a simple yet efficient Java console-based application designed to manage the waiting list (queue) for unavailable books in a library. When a book is not available, students can join a virtual queue. Once the book becomes available, the system automatically serves the next user in line.
